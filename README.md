# Corporate-Travel-Expense-Management
Problem Statement:
In many organizations, employees submit travel and expense claims via emails and spreadsheets, which creates:
>Delays in approvals
>Lack of transparency in reimbursements
>Difficulty in tracking department-wise expenses

Solution:
This Salesforce application digitizes the entire process:
>Employees submit expenses directly in Salesforce
>Automated workflows route claims for Manager + Finance approvals
>Reimbursements are tracked centrally
>Dashboards give HR/Finance a real-time view of costs
