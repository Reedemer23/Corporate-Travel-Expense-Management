# Corporate-Travel-Expense-Management
This project is a Salesforce-based Corporate Travel and Expense Management System designed to streamline how employees submit travel and expense claims, how managers approve them, and how finance teams track reimbursements. 
The system eliminates manual processes, ensures transparency, and provides real-time dashboards for better decision-making.
